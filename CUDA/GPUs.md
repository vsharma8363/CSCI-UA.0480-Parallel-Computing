# GPUs - The Basics
* 3 Goals of Current Architectures
  * *Maintain execution speed* of old sequential programs (CPU)
  * *Increase throughput* of parallel programs (GPU)
  * *Reduce execution time* of non-GPU-friendly programs (Multicore) 
* **Throughput** --> How many threads finish work PER unit time
* Winning Apps --> CPUs + GPUs
  * CPUs do sequential parts
    * Low-level or no-data parallelism
    * 10x faster than GPUs for sequential
  * GPUs do parallel parts
    * 10x faster than CPUs for parallel
