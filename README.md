## About this repo
This contains all the labwork and notes on the Parallel Computing class taught by Mohamed Zahran at NYU for Spring 2022

## Connecting to the [Courant Clusters](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/computeservers)
* Number crunching --> crunchy1-5 (crunchy1.cims.nyu.edu)
* CUDA --> cuda1-5 (cuda1.cims.nyu.edu)
* SSH to access then to your target cluster

### Loading modules
* Loading CUDA module if NVCC isn't available
```
module load cuda-10.1
```
* 10.2 is good in 2022
